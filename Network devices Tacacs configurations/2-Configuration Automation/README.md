This project aims to facilitate the process of onboarding Cisco switches to Cisco ISE for network device administration using TACACS+ through automation using Python code. For organizations with a large number of switches, this can greatly improve efficiency and reduce the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies.

It is important to note that before attempting to automate the process, it is highly recommended to start by adding at least one switch manually and following <a href="https://github.com/Kshehata1990/CISCO-ISE/blob/main/Network devices Tacacs configurations/1- Manual configuration/README.md"> manual configuration guide </a> provided in this repository. This will help ensure that the process is properly understood and that any issues are identified and addressed early on.

After adding one switch manually, it is essential to follow the <a href="https://github.com/Kshehata1990/CISCO-ISE/blob/main/Network devices Tacacs configurations/2-Configuration Automation/Configuration prerequisites/README.md"> automation readiness guide </a> provided in this repository before proceeding with automation. This will help ensure that the network is properly configured and that the automation process will be successful.

Overall, this project offers a streamlined and automated solution for onboarding Cisco switches to Cisco ISE for network device administration, making it an ideal choice for organizations seeking to improve their network management processes.
